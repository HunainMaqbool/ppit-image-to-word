Project Phase 1: Virtual Company
(Learn Professionalism Technically)

Task 1: Basic Image-to-Word Converter (MVP)
Problem: Converting scanned documents or images to editable Word format typically results in
plain, unformatted text. Users lose essential formatting like bold/italic styles, alignment, and
paragraph structure, requiring manual reconstruction.
Objective: Develop a desktop application that extracts text from images while preserving basic
formatting. The tool will accept JPG/PNG inputs, process them using Tesseract OCR, detect
formatting attributes, and generate a formatted .docx file. Sample images are attached.
Scope: Single-page, English-language documents with clear text. Includes image preprocessing,
OCR integration, formatting detection (bold, italic, alignment, paragraphs), and Word document
generation with a simple GUI (Tkinter/PyQt).
Deliverables: Working prototype with source code, project report, and demonstration video.
Outcome: A functional converter that maintains document formatting, reducing post-processing
time. This foundation enables advanced features (equations, multi-language) in later phases.
