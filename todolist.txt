PHASE 0 – Project and Environment Setup
- [ ] Ensure project structure: PRD.txt, README.md, main.py, imgs/ with sample images.
- [ ] Confirm Python version (>= 3.13) and uv installation.
- [ ] In project folder, run: uv sync.
- [ ] Add core dependencies with uv:
      - [ ] pytesseract
      - [ ] Pillow
      - [ ] opencv-python (optional, for preprocessing)
      - [ ] python-docx

PHASE 1 – Basic OCR Pipeline (Plain Text)
- [ ] Implement function: image_path -> plain text string.
- [ ] Load image from imgs/sample1.jpeg.
- [ ] Apply simple preprocessing (grayscale, threshold) if needed.
- [ ] Use pytesseract to extract text.
- [ ] Save or print extracted text for manual inspection.
- [ ] Test OCR on sample1.jpeg, sample2.jpeg, sample3.jpeg.

PHASE 2 – Formatting Extraction (Bold, Italic, Alignment, Paragraphs)
- [ ] Decide simple rules for:
      - [ ] Paragraph detection (gaps / line grouping).
      - [ ] Alignment detection (left/center/right based on x-position).
      - [ ] Bold/italic detection (heuristic based on thickness/darkness or region).
- [ ] Use pytesseract detailed output (e.g., image_to_data) for positions.
- [ ] Implement function: ocr_output -> structured paragraphs with style flags.
- [ ] Log structured output to console/file for checking against original images.

PHASE 3 – DOCX Generation
- [ ] Implement function: structured paragraphs -> .docx using python-docx.
- [ ] Map:
      - [ ] Paragraphs -> doc.add_paragraph().
      - [ ] Bold/italic flags -> runs with bold/italic.
      - [ ] Alignment flags -> paragraph.alignment.
- [ ] Wire full pipeline: image_path -> output.docx.
- [ ] Create an out/ folder (or similar) for generated .docx files.
- [ ] Run end-to-end on all sample images and open .docx to verify.

PHASE 4 – Simple GUI (MVP)
- [ ] Choose GUI toolkit (Tkinter recommended for simplicity).
- [ ] Create main window with:
      - [ ] "Select Image" button (file picker for JPG/PNG).
      - [ ] Label to show selected file path.
      - [ ] "Convert to Word" button.
      - [ ] Status/label for success or failure message.
- [ ] On "Select Image": store chosen path.
- [ ] On "Convert to Word": call full pipeline and save .docx.
- [ ] Show clear success message with output path.
- [ ] Handle basic errors (no file selected, invalid path, Tesseract not found).

PHASE 5 – Polish, Testing, and Deliverables
- [ ] Define output naming scheme (e.g., same name as image with .docx extension).
- [ ] Manual test checklist:
      - [ ] All sample images convert without crashing.
      - [ ] Text is readable in all outputs.
      - [ ] Bold/italic/alignment approximately match originals where possible.
- [ ] Update README.md:
      - [ ] How to install Tesseract on the OS.
      - [ ] uv commands to install deps and run the app.
      - [ ] Simple usage instructions with screenshots if time allows.
- [ ] Draft short project report (architecture + screenshots).
- [ ] Record demo video showing full workflow from image selection to .docx open.
